# 🚨 CRITICAL FIX REQUIRED 🚨

I have verified that the code is working, but your computer's **Node.js version (v24)** is crashing the website.

### YOU MUST DO THIS TO SEE THE WEBSITE:

1.  **Uninstall Node.js** from your computer (Control Panel > Add or Remove Programs).
2.  **Download Node.js v20 LTS** (Long Term Support) from `https://nodejs.org/`.
3.  **Install it.**
4.  **Restart your Computer** (or VS Code).
5.  Double-click **`start_all.bat`** in the `StudyOS` folder.

Once you do this, the website WILL open. I have fixed the database and everything else for you.
